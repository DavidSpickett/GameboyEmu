Another Gameboy (monochrome) emulator written in C++. Very limited compatability,
Tetris is working fine without sound.

Builds on Mac OSX El Capitan and requires the SDL2 library. Command line options are
as follows:
    --rom=<path rom>     Load the ROM file from the given path.
    --numcycles=<number> Number of CPU cycles to run before saving a screenshot
                         and quiting. Mainly for testing.
    skipboot             Skip the boot ROM. If not given then a BIOS file called
                         "GameBoyBios.gb" is required in the same folder as the
                         emulator.
    --scale=<number>     Set the dimension of each pixel on screen. 1 means 1 Gameboy
                         pixel is one pixel on screen. 2 means each pixel is a 2x2 square
                         and so on. Note that screenshots are taken at the window size
                         not the Gameboy's resouloution.

Input keys:
    UP      up arrow
    DOWN    down arrow
    LEFT    left arrow
    RIGHT   right arrow
    B       z
    A       x
    START   enter
    SELECT  right shift

You can also press 's' to take a screenshot and then exit (printing the no. of cycles ran) or
press 'esc' to quit directly.

Things to do/known issues:
    - Upon loosing a round of Tetris the screen fills with blocks apart from the last row.
    - Window display is not working. (pause menu in Super Mario Land)
    - Sound is completely non functional.
    - LCD doesn't report modes, so Super Mario Land's scrolling doesn't work.
    - 2 player serial over a socket (Tetris).
    - Test framework, which is what the screenshot functions are for evenutally.
    - Background scrolling has some corruption (opus5.gb).
    - Get the GDB Handler working with the GDB Z80 port.
